> All commands are available in the file explorer context menu when right-clicking on `.confluence` files or folders, in the "Confluence Smart Publisher" submenu.

#### "Publish Document" Command Flow

The **Publish Document** command (`publishConfluence`) executes a series of steps to ensure that the content of the `.confluence` file is correctly published or updated on Confluence, keeping metadata and properties synchronized. See the detailed flow:

1. **User Action**
   - The user right-clicks on a `.confluence` file and selects "Publish Document" or executes the corresponding command from the VSCode command menu.

2. **Initial Validation**
   - The command checks if the selected file has the `.confluence` extension. If not, it displays an error message.

3. **File Reading**
   - The file content is read for analysis and information extraction.

4. **Page ID Verification**
   - The system looks for the `<csp:file_id>` tag in the `<csp:parameters>` block.
     - **If it exists**: understands that the page was previously published and performs an update on Confluence.
     - **If it doesn't exist**: creates a new page on Confluence.

5. **Page Creation or Update**
   - Creation:
     - Extracts information such as title, parentId, labels, and properties from the <csp:parameters> block.
     - Removes the <csp:parameters> block from the content before sending to Confluence.
     - Creates the page via Confluence REST API.
     - If there are referenced local images, performs a second update to attach them correctly.
   - Update:
     - Extracts the page ID.
     - Removes the <csp:parameters> block from the content.
     - Updates the page content via REST API.
     - If there are referenced local images, performs a second update to attach them correctly.

6. **Metadata Synchronization**
   - Adds labels defined in the <csp:labels_list> tag.
   - Updates properties defined in the <csp:properties> tag.

7. **ID Persistence**
   - If the page was created (no <csp:file_id> existed), writes the new ID at the beginning of the local file, inside the <csp:parameters> block.

8. **User Feedback**
   - Displays a success message with the ID of the published page or an error message if something fails.
>Note: The entire flow is executed transparently, with logs in the "Output | CSP" panel of VSCode to facilitate diagnosis in case of problems.


### üîÑ UNIQUE FEATURE: Metadata synchronization!

> `Labels`, `Properties`, `PageId`, and `ParentId` are always kept up-to-date between the local file and the remote page on Confluence.  
> **Any changes made locally (or in Confluence) are transparently reflected, avoiding inconsistencies and facilitating version control and organization of your documents.**

> **Important Note:** To ensure metadata synchronization, you need to use the "Sync with Published on Confluence" command. This command will compare and synchronize all metadata between your local file and the remote page, allowing you to choose which version to keep. Without using this command, metadata changes made in Confluence won't be automatically reflected in your local file.

### üîç Validations and Diagnostics

The Confluence Smart Publisher extension offers several validation and diagnostic features to ensure the integrity and quality of your documents:

#### üìù Structure Validation
- **Real-time Validation**: Checks the document structure as you type, ensuring all required tags are present and properly formatted.
- **Tag Diagnostics**: Identifies missing, malformed, or invalid attributes, displaying warnings directly in the editor.
- **Attribute Validation**: Verifies if required attributes are present and if their values are valid.

#### üëÅÔ∏è Visual Diagnostics
- **Error Markers**: Structure issues are highlighted with red underlines in the editor.
- **Correction Tips**: Hovering over errors displays suggestions on how to fix the problem.
- **Problems List**: All issues found are listed in the VS Code "Problems" panel.

#### ‚úÖ Specific Validations
- **Metadata Validation**: Checks if the `<csp:parameters>` block is present and properly formatted.
- **ID Validation**: Confirms if page and parent IDs are in valid format.
- **Label Validation**: Verifies if labels are in correct format and don't contain invalid characters.
- **Properties Validation**: Ensures page properties are in valid format.

#### üîß Auto-correction
- **Automatic Formatting**: When saving the file, the extension can automatically fix formatting issues.
- **Indentation Correction**: Automatically adjusts XML indentation for better readability.
- **Tag Normalization**: Standardizes tag formatting to maintain document consistency.

#### üìä Logs and Diagnostics
- **Log Panel**: All operations are logged in the VS Code "Output | CSP" panel.
- **Error Diagnostics**: In case of publication or synchronization failure, detailed logs are generated to facilitate problem identification.
- **Operation Status**: Visual feedback on ongoing operations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Confluence Cloud (Atlassian) account with edit permission.
- Confluence API Token (generate at [https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)).

## üîß Extension Settings

This extension adds the following settings to VSCode:

| Key                                              | Description                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `confluenceSmartPublisher.baseUrl`               | Base URL of your Confluence instance (e.g., https://company.atlassian.net/wiki)              |
| `confluenceSmartPublisher.username`              | Confluence username (usually email)                                                          |
| `confluenceSmartPublisher.apiToken`              | Confluence API Token                                                                         |
| `confluenceSmartPublisher.format.numberChapters` | Automatically numbers chapters when formatting the `.confluence` document (default: true)    |
| `confluenceSmartPublisher.htmlEntitiesDecode`    | Activates automatic conversion of HTML entities to special characters when downloading pages (default: false) |

## üìÑ .confluence File Structure
This extension adds a `<csp:parameters>` block to the document, which is used internally by the Confluence Smart Publisher extension, and whose values can be modified.

`<csp:file_id>`: Page ID in Confluence (automatically filled after publication).

`<csp:labels_list>`: List of labels separated by commas. Additions and changes will be reflected on the online page.

`<csp:parent_id>`: Parent page ID in Confluence.

`<csp:properties>`: Page properties (key/value). These properties can be changed, deleted, or new ones included. But be careful as changes may cause unexpected effects.

Example:
```xml
<csp:parameters xmlns:csp="https://confluence.smart.publisher/csp">
  <csp:file_id>123456</csp:file_id>
  <csp:labels_list>user-story,scope,pending</csp:labels_list>
  <csp:parent_id>654321</csp:parent_id>
  <csp:properties>
    <csp:key>content-appearance-published</csp:key>
    <csp:value>fixed-width</csp:value>
  </csp:properties>
</csp:parameters>
<!-- Page content in Confluence Storage format -->
```
