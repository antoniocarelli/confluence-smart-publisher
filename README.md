# Confluence Smart Publisher

Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to create, edit, publish, download, compare, and synchronize Confluence pages directly from your editor, using `.confluence` files in a custom XML format.
This extension uses the Confluence Storage format.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Direct publishing**: Publish `.confluence` files as pages on Confluence with a single click.
- **Page downloading**: Download Confluence pages by title or ID, converting them to local editable format.
- **Synchronization**: Compare and synchronize local content with what's published on Confluence, choosing which version to keep.
- **Template-based creation**: Create new files based on Confluence template pages.
- **Automatic formatting**: Format `.confluence` files with specific rules, including automatic chapter numbering.
- **Structure validation**: Real-time diagnostics of required tags, structure, and attributes, displaying issues in VSCode.
- **Tag auto-completion**: Smart suggestions for Confluence custom tags and attributes.
- **Smart snippets**: Automatic suggestions of XML code blocks for custom tags, with completion of required and optional attributes, speeding up document writing. Just type `csp` and the options will appear like magic!
- **Html Entities Decode**: Automatic conversion of HTML entities to special characters when downloading pages.
- **Set title emoji**: Easily add emojis to your page titles directly in VSCode.

### üöÄ UNIQUE FEATURE: Metadata synchronization!

> `Labels`, `Properties`, `PageId`, and `ParentId` are always kept up-to-date between the local file and the remote page on Confluence.  
> **Any changes made locally (or in Confluence) are transparently reflected, avoiding inconsistencies and facilitating version control and organization of your documents.**

All commands are available in the file explorer context menu when right-clicking on `.confluence` files or folders, in the "Confluence Smart Publisher" submenu.

### üîÑ "Publish Document" Command Flow

The **Publish Document** command (`publishConfluence`) executes a series of steps to ensure that the content of the `.confluence` file is correctly published or updated on Confluence, keeping metadata and properties synchronized. See the detailed flow:

1. **User Action**
   - The user right-clicks on a `.confluence` file and selects "Publish Document" or executes the corresponding command from the VSCode command menu.

2. **Initial Validation**
   - The command checks if the selected file has the `.confluence` extension. If not, it displays an error message.

3. **File Reading**
   - The file content is read for analysis and information extraction.

4. **Page ID Verification**
   - The system looks for the `<csp:file_id>` tag in the `<csp:parameters>` block.
     - **If it exists**: understands that the page was previously published and performs an update on Confluence.
     - **If it doesn't exist**: creates a new page on Confluence.

5. **Page Creation or Update**
   - **Creation**:
     - Extracts information such as title, `parentId`, labels, and properties from the `<csp:parameters>` block.
     - Removes the `<csp:parameters>` block from the content before sending to Confluence.
     - Creates the page via Confluence REST API.
     - If there are referenced local images, performs a second update to attach them correctly.
   - **Update**:
     - Extracts the page ID.
     - Removes the `<csp:parameters>` block from the content.
     - Updates the page content via REST API.
     - If there are referenced local images, performs a second update to attach them correctly.

6. **Metadata Synchronization**
   - Adds labels defined in the `<csp:labels_list>` tag.
   - Updates properties defined in the `<csp:properties>` tag.

7. **ID Persistence**
   - If the page was created (no `<csp:file_id>` existed), writes the new ID at the beginning of the local file, inside the `<csp:parameters>` block.

8. **User Feedback**
   - Displays a success message with the ID of the published page or an error message if something fails.

> **Note:** The entire flow is executed transparently, with logs in the "Confluence Smart Publisher" panel of VSCode to facilitate diagnosis in case of problems.

## üìÑ `.confluence` File Structure

This extension adds a `<csp:parameters>` block to the document, which is used internally by the Confluence Smart Publisher extension, and whose values can be modified.

- `<csp:file_id>`: Page ID in Confluence (automatically filled after publication).
- `<csp:labels_list>`: List of labels separated by commas. Additions and changes will be reflected on the online page.
- `<csp:parent_id>`: Parent page ID in Confluence.
- `<csp:properties>`: Page properties (key/value). These properties can be changed, deleted, or new ones included. But be careful as changes may cause unexpected effects.

Example:
```xml
<csp:parameters xmlns:csp="https://confluence.smart.publisher/csp">
  <csp:file_id>123456</csp:file_id>
  <csp:labels_list>user-story,scope,pending</csp:labels_list>
  <csp:parent_id>654321</csp:parent_id>
  <csp:properties>
    <csp:key>content-appearance-published</csp:key>
    <csp:value>fixed-width</csp:value>
  </csp:properties>
</csp:parameters>
<!-- Page content in Confluence Storage format -->
```
