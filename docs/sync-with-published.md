### "Sync with Published" Command Flow

The **Sync with Published** command (`syncWithPublished`) executes a series of steps to synchronize local content with the published version on Confluence. See the detailed flow:

1. **Initial Validation**
   - The command checks if the selected file has the `.confluence` extension
   - Validates if the file contains a valid page ID in `<csp:parameters>`
   - Verifies Confluence connectivity

2. **Content Comparison**
   - Downloads the current published version from Confluence
   - Compares local and published content
   - Identifies differences in:
     - Main content
     - Labels
     - Properties
     - Title and emojis

3. **Sync Options**
   - Presents the user with sync options:
     - Update local with online content
     - Update Confluence with local content
     - Cancel operation

4. **Sync Execution**
   - If updating local:
     - Downloads and converts published content
     - Updates local file while preserving CSP structure
   - If updating Confluence:
     - Converts local content to Confluence format
     - Updates the page via REST API
     - Syncs all metadata, properties and images

5. **User Feedback**
   - Displays a success message or an error message if something fails
