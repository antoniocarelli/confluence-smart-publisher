### "Convert to Confluence Format" Command Flow

The **Convert to Confluence Format** command (`convertMarkdown`) executes a series of steps to transform a Markdown file into the Confluence Storage Format. See the detailed flow:

1. **Initial Validation**

2. **File Reading**
   - The file content is read for analysis and conversion.

3. **Markdown Parsing**
   - The system parses the Markdown content, identifying:
     - Headers and their levels
     - Lists (ordered and unordered)
     - Code blocks
     - Tables
     - Links and images
     - Text formatting (bold, italic, etc.)

4. **Confluence Format Conversion**
   - Converts each Markdown element to its Confluence Storage Format equivalent
   - Maintains the document structure
   - Preserves formatting and styling

5. **File Creation**
   - Creates a new `.confluence` file with the same name as the original
   - Writes the converted content to the new file
   - Preserves the original Markdown file

6. **User Feedback**
   - Displays a success message with the path of the created file or an error message if something fails

>Note: The entire flow is executed transparently, with logs in the "Output | CSP" panel of VSCode to facilitate diagnosis in case of problems.
